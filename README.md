6. **Largest Number Finder** – Identify the largest number in a list
7. **Vowel Counter** – Count how many vowels appear in a string
8. **Math Function** – Return the sum, difference, and product of two numbers
9. **String Reverser** – Reverse a string without using slicing (`[::-1]`)
10. **Fibonacci Generator** – Output the first 10 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence

Each exercise is simplified, focused, and structured to build a solid Python foundation.
