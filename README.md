Beginner-friendly Python exercises, tasks and practice files inspired by DataraFlow Python Crash Course—perfect for building confidence and developing strong programming habits.
These practice tasks are ideal for anyone starting out with Python or revisiting the basics.
## About the Repository
This repository is organized into three main categories:

### 1. Basic Exercises
Foundational Python exercises to build core skills such as loops, functions, conditionals, and basic algorithms.

**Examples:**
- Print `"Hello, World!"`  
- Check if a number is even or odd  
- Generate the first 10 numbers of the Fibonacci sequence  

### 2. Assignments
Practical programs that simulate real-world scenarios to apply Python concepts.

**Examples:**
- Student Grades System: calculate averages and assign grades  
- Simple Calculator: perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division  
- Shopping Cart: track items and total cost  

### 3. Assessments
Concept-based questions and exercises to test understanding of Python fundamentals.

**Examples:**
- Explain the difference between a list and a tuple  
- Swap two variables without a third variable  
- Write a function that returns all even numbers from a list
  
Each exercise/task/assessment is simplified, focused, and structured to build a solid Python foundation.
